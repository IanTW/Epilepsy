1) Wrap code in functions where practical
2) Split code into logical separate files ala Python main()
3) Document as you go
4) Commit to Git !

Functional blocks of code:

Main          - set up and load packages
              - call functions

Preprocessing - data preparation

Features      - extraction
              - feature vector construction
              - dimensionality reduction

Algorithm     - training
              - testing
              - parameter tuning

Performance   - evaluation
              - comparison

Graphics      - plots
              - tables?
