Notes

.mat file is a list of lists

Not clear if resampling is necessary. Patient_1 and Patient_2 data has higher sample rate (I believe). This can be a part of the different studies that are undertaken - variations on sample rate as part of data preparation to see if different results are obtained. Also vary window size of data.

You need to decompose the data files. Dataset -> File -> Windowed Files -> EEG Channel - Time series (might make a good figure?)  

To Do
Print detailed project plan and platicise
Put milestones into Google calendar
Decide on a train/test/holdout split
Figure out how to plot EEG. EEGkit may only work on a EDF. Matt Craddock new library
is not on CRAN and only has install instructions for Bash.
Weekly progress report
Investigate R signal processing packages
Read through Kaggle detection 2014 discussions for R coding ideas

Dataset size
Dog1 - 1006 files
Dog2 - 1542 files
Dog3 - 2416 files
Dog4 - 1891 files
Dog5 - 671 files
Pat1 - 263 files
Pat2 - 210 files
Total 7999

Experimental option - specific or non-specific. Train and test on Dog_1. Then see if Dog_1 can be used to predict others. Repeat for all patients.

Signal processing packages:

Spectral
TSA

Package e1071 for SVM
Package erpR for ERP may have some function?
package moments for statistical moments

Progress report
Sunday 6 hours coding

There are two branches for the ESIA code - do you have the latest?

Use .ts time series class in R for EEG 

Going to need to downsample Patient files to same rate as Dog files. The file are longer ? so will generate different size feature vectors

List of wei wu features
    Per channel and per series (orig, Delta1 and Delta2, FFT(orig), FFT(D1), FFT(D2))
    Max, mean, SD, max Freq (for FFT)

    Per slice (across all channels and all features)
    Max, mean, abs(Standard Dev)

    All features averaged across all channels and then again made into Orig, Delta1, Delta2, FFT etc.
    Max, mean, SD etc as per ind. channel
    
    Covariance matrix of original -> mean, max, sd, 2nd max, 3rd max (what is this?)
    covariance of FFT matrix
