Design Rules

1) Wrap code in functions where practical
2) Split code into logical separate files ala Python main()
3) Document as you go
4) Commit to Git !

Functional blocks of code:

Main          - main code sequence                     - SeizurePrediction.R        - in progress

Preprocessing - data preparation                       - RenameTestData.R
              - data error checking                    - ??????????????             - in testing
              - data metadata/summary                  - GetMetaData.R              - in development

Features      - generate                                
              - extraction
              - feature vector construction
              - dimensionality reduction

Algorithm     - training
              - testing
              - parameter tuning

Performance   - evaluation
              - comparison

Graphics      - plots
              - tables?

Notes

.mat file is a list of lists

Not clear if resampling is necessary. Patient_1 and Patient_2 data has higher sample rate (I believe). This can be a part of the different studies that are undertaken - variations on sample rate as part of data preparation to see if different results are obtained. Also vary window size of data.

Wei Wu code has feature generation that does not use windowing - identify and remove


To Do
Print detailed project plan and platicise
Put milestones into Google calendar
Decide on a train/test/holdout split
Refile data files on One Drive in individual folders per patient
Figure out how to plot EEG. EEGkit may only work on a EDF. Matt Craddock new library
is not on CRAN and only has install instructions for Bash.
Set up weekly update template in ppt.
Investigate R signal processing packages
Read through Kaggle discussions for R coding ideas
