Design

1) Wrap code in functions where practical
2) Split code into logical separate files ala Python main()
3) Document as you go
4) Commit to Git !




***Found the labels for the test data on Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-prediction/discussion/10955


Functional blocks of code:

Main          - set up and load packages
              - call functions

Preprocessing - data preparation

Features      - extraction
              - feature vector construction
              - dimensionality reduction

Algorithm     - training
              - testing
              - parameter tuning

Performance   - evaluation
              - comparison

Graphics      - plots
              - tables?

Notes

.mat file is a list of lists

Not clear if resampling is necessary. Patient_1 and Patient_2 data has higher sample rate (I believe). This can be a part of the different studies that are undertaken - variations on sample rate as part of data preparation to see if different results are obtained. Also vary window size of data.

Wei Wu code has feature generation that does not use windowing - identify and remove


To Do
Print detailed project plan and platicise
Put milestones into Google calendar
Decide on a train/test/holdout split
Refile data files on One Drive in individual folders per patient
Move test data into One Drive with labels - relabel with labels - ass pain?
Figure out how to plot EEG. EEGkit may only work on a EDF. Matt Craddock new library
is not on CRAN and only has install instructions for Bash.
