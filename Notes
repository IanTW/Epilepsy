Notes

.mat file is a list of lists

Not clear if resampling is necessary. Patient_1 and Patient_2 data has higher sample rate (I believe). This can be a part of the different studies that are undertaken - variations on sample rate as part of data preparation to see if different results are obtained. Also vary window size of data.

You need to decompose the data files. Dataset -> File -> Windowed Files -> EEG Channel - Time series (might make a good figure?)  

To Do
Print detailed project plan and platicise
Decide on a train/test/holdout split
Figure out how to plot EEG. EEGkit may only work on a EDF. Matt Craddock new library
is not on CRAN and only has install instructions for Bash.
Weekly progress report
Investigate R signal processing packages
Read through Kaggle detection 2014 discussions for R coding ideas

Dataset size
Dog1 - 1006 files
Dog2 - 1542 files
Dog3 - 2416 files
Dog4 - 1891 files
Dog5 - 671 files
Pat1 - 263 files
Pat2 - 210 files
Total 7999

Experimental option - specific or non-specific. Train and test on Dog_1. Then see if Dog_1 can be used to predict others. Repeat for all patients.

Signal processing packages:

Spectral
TSA

Package e1071 for SVM
Package erpR for ERP may have some function?

There are two branches for the ESIA code - do you have the latest?

Use .ts time series class in R for EEG 

Going to need to downsample Patient files to same rate as Dog files?

Some files have 15 and 24 channels = these will give differnt length feature vectors.....


    

Code to do 
Sliding window
Normalisation function
Cross validation 
Derivative function
Channel averaging
Downsampling
Filter out files with too few/many channels (randomly pick 16?)

Report to do
References - check DOI has been added in Zotero before export
Remove URLs where DOI is available

Questions for Brendan
Can feature vectors be different lengths?
Can I pad with zeroes or an average? How do I treat missing data?
Can I randomly pick 16 channels from 24?
