Results       - evaluation
              - comparison

Graphics      - plots
              - tables?


Keep in mind this is a classification comparison!!!!! Experiments should focus on this!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Experimental Options:
Window size (60s/10s ....)
Specific or non-specific [Train and test on Dog_1. Then see if Dog_1 can be used to predict others. Repeat for all patients.]
Sets of features
Types of validation (simple partition), kfold cross validation, leave one out cross validation
Oversampling minority, undersampling majority, SMOTE




To Do
Figure out how to plot EEG with Matt Craddock - new library is not on CRAN and only has install instructions for Bash.
Weekly progress report
Read through Kaggle detection 2014 discussions for R coding ideas

seewave - spectrogram and fundamental freq ('fund()') and dominant 'dfreq()'

TSA
Package e1071 for SVM
Package erpR for ERP may have some function?
spectrum function in stats package - meh
fftw
fftfilt
tune R -spectral components made for audio i think
wavelets

Code to do 
Cross validation 

Report to do
References - check DOI has been added in Zotero before export
Remove URLs where DOI is available

Questions for Brendan

How do I classify the slices (simple majority?)

Notes on Standard scores
If you want to use standard scores there is an assumption of a normal dist.
Normal distribution can be checked using Shapiro Wilks test 
shapiro.test(x) but limited to 5000 points..
You can also do a QQplot
qqnorm(x) versus a normal dist using qqnorm(rnorm(1000))
5000 points of EEG channel is not normally distributed.
See Kelleher textbook pp.93-94
