Design

1) Wrap code in functions where practical
2) Split code into logical separate files ala Python main()
3) Document as you go
4) Commit to Git !




***Found the labels for the test data on Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-prediction/discussion/10955


Functional blocks of code:

Main          - set up and load packages
              - call functions

Preprocessing - data preparation

Features      - extraction
              - feature vector construction
              - dimensionality reduction

Algorithm     - training
              - testing
              - parameter tuning

Performance   - evaluation
              - comparison

Graphics      - plots
              - tables?

Notes

.mat file is a list of lists


To Do
Refile data files on One Drive in individual folders per patient
Move test data into One Drive with labels - relabel with labels - ass pain?
